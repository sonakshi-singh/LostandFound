# LostandFound
Lost and Found management System locally hosted in netbeans. Screenshots provided. It is a web software for an institution to manage their lost and found inventory in a more efficient manner. The aim of the project is to transform the existing traditional system into a more sophisticated software. 

B.1 Overall Description of the project in terms of Product perspective, product functions and user Characteristics  
We are going to implement a website with two major roles:
a)	The requester 
b)	The administrator

Product functions:

The requester will have to fill out a form with all the details of his or her missing article. 
These requests will be accessible by the admin department who will take the required action.
There will be an existing database to manage the flow of the outgoing and the incoming articles. 
The previous records will also be accessible only by the admin department.

User characteristics:
〈	The user (requester) can file a lost complaint by entering the details of the lost item, time field and last location, his contact details paving way for quick response from the admin department.
〈	The user (admin department) can keep tabs in an efficient way by updating the status of the lost and found items and their respective rightful owners.
〈	The user can access the software anytime and anywhere as per their convenience. 

B.2 System study and analysis 
Step1: 
Existing System 
The current system manages the lost and found inventory manually by maintaining records on registers and entering all the details of the person along with their signature to assure that the item has reached the rightful owner. The security guards of the premises collect all the lost items and coordinate with the staff of each respective floor.



Proposed System
The proposed system manages the lost and found inventory by maintaining a software database accessed by a website. The software can be accessed by the users anytime, anywhere and the records need not be manually maintained which reduces the possibility of manual error to a great extent. Also, this proposed system will ensure that the lost item reaches the rightful owner as soon as possible. 

Advantage of proposed system:
〈	Lost articles won’t be misplaced or reach wrong hands if the complaint has been filed in time and if the details of the item is correctly specified.
〈	The software can be accessed anytime and anywhere according to the convenience of the user.
〈	Since the traditional pen & paper system of maintaining records is being digitalized by maintaining a database, there is lesser hassle of human error.
